			<h5 style="color:#5C0516">WOODLANDS PACKS HOME CARE GIFT FOR CITY THIS FESTIVE SEASON</h5>
						<p>Woodlands has stepped outside the hospital premises so that Kolkatans seeking treatment and care do not have to step out of their homes in these difficult times.<br><br>
						The hospital has launched its Home Care initiative to bring to the doorsteps of the people of the city all modalities of care, including attendant and nursing services,doctor consultation,dietician care, diagnostic services, health check-upand various speciality care and physiotherapy – with the promise of top-of-the-line quality that is synonymous with the 75-year-old name of Woodlands.<br><br>
						The speciality care under Woodlands Home Care, includes Baby Care, Cardiac Care, Elderly Care, Neurology Care,Palliative Care, Post-Operative Care, Pulmonology Care and Tracheostomy Care. Medical devices like oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders and cardiac monitors can be rented under the programme while devices like pulse oxymeters and steam vaporizers can also be purchased as a medical kit. Every attendant, nurse, doctor or technician would be fully vaccinated and observe Covid protocols, the hospital authorities said.<br><br>
						A novel feature of the Woodlands Home Care programme is “Doctor Consultation”, under which a doctor would pay a visit at the patient’s home and conduct his clinical examination, like the old times reviving the concept of the House Physician.<br><br>
						Under Home Health Check-up, the hospitaloffers four different packages – Basic, Advanced, Advanced Plus and Complete– specifically taking into account the need for fit and healthy life.Tailormade Health Check-ups would enable corporate executives, homemakers, children and senior citizens to book the service at their convenient time, at office or home.<br><br>
						We will also provide physiotherapy at home, which will come in handy especially for rehabilitation of patients recovering after joint replacement surgeries, neuro surgeries and any other procedures. Therapy for speech and swallow dysfunction can also be availed.<br><br>
						Customised medical kits will be provided for the different specialised packages on the basis of doctor’s assessment. A multi-disciplinary Home Care team will visit the patient’s home prior to final allotment of the services.<br>
						Payments for services underHome Care can be made digitally, through bank transfers, PayTM and other modes of online payments, which essentially means that someone staying outside Kolkata can easily book a service and make the payment for their near and dear ones living in the city.</p>
